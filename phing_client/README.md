These are the Phing build files you'll put in your working copy of
the project.

I tend to make a folder called 'pull' and put the Git clone client in there.

For the lint client, I tend to put it in the existing project folder for
unit tests etc. Or I make a new folder called 'tests' and put it in
there.
